# kekcat

### what is it?

kekcat is a node.js reimplementation/improvement of the popular [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat) ruby program written in TypeScript.

### what can it do?

- io piping
- different color blending modes
- enable/disable random start position in the gradient
- create custom gradient by defining your own color stops
- trippy animations!

### how do I install it?
```
npm install -g kekcat
```

### what still needs to get implemented?

- custom gradient domain (defining the curve of the gradient scale)
- easy way to preview different settings
- parsing an already colored input correctly so rendering doesn't get messed up
- hue shifting an already colored input
